THE GAME
========

This is a game.  It uses Twisted, pygame, and OpenGL.

Based on the Gam3 located:
http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~game-hackers/game/trunk/view/head:/game/player.py

SETUP
-----------
Clone the repo
Run a web server locally to serve the Javascript and the HTML for the Web Client
Config the web server to serve the files by using links or a HTTP config. This is based on the web server you are using 
	and the platform.

RUNNING
-------

To run the game server, issue the command in the /SCRAM folder:
  twistd scram

This will start twistd, the Twisted daemon, acting as a SCRAM server.
By default, it will run on TCP port 1337.

To run the game client from the /SCRAM folder:
  PYTHONPATH=./ python ./game/scripts/network_client.py

Once the SCRAM client is running, it will listen for connections to the various services:
	* port 8081 is the Poll Service
	



DEPENDENCIES
------------

The game client and server depend on several packages.
 * Twisted - it's Twisted           <http://twistedmatrix.com/>
 * Pygame - SDL graphics and sound  <http://www.pygame.org/>
 * NumPy - numeric processing       <http://numpy.scipy.org/>
 * PyOpenGL - accelerated graphics  <http://pyopengl.sourceforge.net/>
 * Epsilon - useful utility package <http://launchpad.net/divmod.org/>

These libraries are packaged for many operating systems.  For example, on
Debian/Ubuntu systems, you can install several of them with:
  sudo apt-get install python-twisted python-pygame python-numpy python-opengl

For unpackaged libraries, or on other platforms, you can install using
easy_install.  For information on how to get easy_install, see:
  http://packages.python.org/distribute/easy_install.html

To install each of the prerequisite packages, run easy_install with
the package name as its argument.  For example, to install Twisted:
  easy_install twisted
or, on UNIX-like systems:
  sudo easy_install twisted  # To install for all users.
